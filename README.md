# Universal Connector
Connects entities (basically anything - IP cams, file servers, robots,..)
monitoring the interfaces they communicate via. Monitoring is performed by calling
predefined DLL functions (DLL functions with predefined names, arguments, and return values).
Those DLLs must be implemented by a competent programmer.

Code commentaries are very comprehensive, read them to get into how the program
works - we don't have a documentation yet.
